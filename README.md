### Source Information

This website is built with

- [SvelteKit (Frontend Framework)](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Slickscroll (Scroll Effects)](https://github.com/Musab-Hassan/slickscrolljs)
- [Anime (Animations)](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime)
- [Three.js (3D Effects)](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)

This is the source for version 2+. Version 1.0, the one built with jQuery is in the [v1 branch](https://github.com/Musab-Hassan/musabhassan.com/tree/v1).

### Developing

The site is just a regular SvelteKit project, with ssr disabled.

For development, start the vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

*Note: Due to migration from Rollup, HMR breaks the site. You have to do a full reload if you modify any components or TS files.*

For production, build the site:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Contributing

You can fork this repo and modify it however I wont really be accepting pull requests due to the nature of the website being based on "taste" and a showcase of my work.

If you decide to use this site for your own commercial work, replace my personal logos with yours.

Please don't use my personal logos as yours.
